Welcome to The Invisible Job Board
Project Overview
The Invisible Job Board is a highly interactive job portal where job listings are hidden by default and only revealed when users input their skills. The platform dynamically filters and displays job postings based on the user's skill set, prioritizes matches with 80%+ relevance, and ensures a seamless user experience with smooth animations, predictive assistance, and mobile responsiveness.

Key Features
Complete Concealment:

Job listings are hidden by default.

Users must input at least one skill to view job postings.

Skill-Driven Discovery:

Users manually input their skills in a responsive input field.

As skills are entered, job postings matching at least one skill dynamically appear.

Relevance-Based Prioritization:

Jobs with 80%+ alignment with the user's skill set are marked as "Top Match."

Job listings are sorted by relevance, with the most relevant jobs appearing first.

Adaptive Ordering Mechanism:

Job postings are dynamically reordered based on the user's input.

Predictive Assistance:

The input field suggests skills as the user types, using the O*NET Skills API.

Smooth Visual Transitions:

Job postings gradually appear with elegant animations using Framer Motion.

Mobile Responsiveness:

The platform is optimized for all screen sizes, especially mobile devices.
